        <div id="BodyDiv"><h1 id="About">About Imperial Panda Games</h1>

        <p>Imperial Panda Games refers to the group of products created by me, Alex J. Fehr, a hobbyist game developer. These products 
           include board, card, and video games that I brainstorm, design, and create myself. While Imperial Panda Games is 
           not yet an official company and has only one employee, myself, it is impossible to know where it will end up. Many 
           Imperial Panda Games product releases lie just around the corner, so stay tuned for updates!<br>As a Christian, I believe
           that all activities, even creating games, should be done for the glory of the Lord. I believe He can use even games as a way
            to glorify Himself and carry out His will. As a result, my goal is to create games as my example Jesus would if He were in my
            place.<br><br>If you are interested in helping create or test Imperial Panda Games' products, you can reach me through
            Facebook at my profile for Alex Fehr.</p>

        <p>Though this category is made up of the smallest number of products (with only 1 in development), such games are the main focus
            of Imperial Panda Games.
        </p>

        <h3>Pentad Knights: A Beginning and an End</h3>

        <h4>Projected Completion Date: October 2019 (Beta Version)</h4>

        <p>Imperial Panda Games' first original video game has been in development for over two years. It is the first game in a planned 
            series of seven. It is an fantasy action-adventure game that can be played single-player or, for a great teamwork experience, 
            can be played by up to four players across two computers. Explore and fight your way through the land of Therion as you 
            follow the path of five young men on their journey to rid their land of the evil and war plaguing it. Along the way, you 
            will meet allies and enemies that you will encounter throughout the rest of the series. This game has enterred the Alpha version
            and is available for Beta testing. If you are interested in joining the Beta Test Team, you can get in touch with me through
            my email at ajfehr1@gmail.com.

        <h2 id="CompletedVG">Completed Games</h2>

        <p>No games at this point. <strong>Pentad Knights: A Beginning and an End</strong> will be the first one.</p>

        <h2 id="ReleasedVG">Released Games</h2>

        <p>No games at this point. <strong>Pentad Knights: A Beginning and an End</strong> will probably be the first one, but the exact method of
            release is still uncertain.
        </p>

        <h1 id="BoardGames">Board Games</h1>

        <p>Many games in this category have been experimented with. It is uncertain as of yet which will be pursued and released.</p>

        <h3>For Gold, Good, or Glory</h3>

        <h4>Projected Completion Date: Unknown</h4>

        <p>A new spin on table-top rpgs like Dungeons and Dragons, this game began as an idea for an massively-multiplayer online video 
            game and made its way into a board game. The flagship board game of Imperial Panda Games, this game is one of the biggest 
            projects I've undertaken and incorporates a lot of experience and lessons learned across a slew of other games. It features
            player-versus-player combat or player-versus-enemy combat for up to twenty players. A powerful yet easily understood combat system
            and a slew of items and character custimization make for an engrossing experience. This game has enterred the playable
            Alpha stage of development but is far from complete. Even after completion, it will see several expansion options, including
            a playable storyline.
        </p>

        <h3>Fortica</h3>

        <h4>Projected Completion Date: Unknown</h4>

        <p>Do you love action, adventure, and <strong>Legos</strong>? Then you'll enjoy this game. Played on a custom board designed
        and built by <strong>you</strong> out of Legos, Fortica is a game of exploration and monster-fighting. Designed for
        anyone from master builders to those aspiring to be, this game is not only a board game; it is a creative
        opportunity. The only component of the game is the rulebook: the rest is created by you! This game is currently fully playable, 
        but no one except I can understand the rulebook, so it is not yet termed complete.</p>

        <h2 id="CompletedBG">Completed Games</h2>

        <p>No games at this point. It is uncertain at the current point which games and ideas I will bring to completion, the 
            most likely ones being <strong>Fortica</strong> and <strong>For Gold, Good, or Glory</strong>.
            </p>

        <h2 id="ReleasedBG">Released Games</h2>

        <p>No games at this point. Most likely, the first release will be <strong>For Gold, Good, or Glory</strong>.</p>

        <h2 id="InDevelopmentCG">In Development</h2>

        <h3>Land of Legends</h3>

        <h4>Projected Completion Date: Unknown</h4>

        <p>In this deck-building card game, you will battle monsters, collect loot and equipment, and enlist allies to help you
            in your quest to become the foremost warrior in the land. A game for up to four players, it is a bit less complicated than
            some deck-building games, making it an excellent introduction to the genre. It is nearly complete, with only a few more cards
            needing to be added. It may also receive an expansion after completion.
        </p>

        <h2 id="CompletedCG">Completed Games</h2>

        <p>No games at this point. Land of Legends is nearly ready to join this category.</p>

        <h2 id="ReleasedCG">Released Games</h2>
        <p>No games at this point. It is uncertain what games will end up here when.</p>
